# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'

      history: History
      history_desc_1: The Russian Blue cat is a breed with mysterious origins, associated with northern Russia, specifically the Archangel Isles. Rumor has it that it descends from the cats of the Russian czars. If the Russian Blue indeed migrated from northern Russia, it likely occurred by ship to England and northern Europe in the mid-19th century. Even though merchant ships were traveling between this area and the British Isles since the 16th century, and Vikings operated in both regions centuries earlier, there is no mention of the Russian Blue breed until the 19th century.
      history_desc_2: In 1875, the Russian Blue cat made its public debut in London at the Crystal Palace exhibition under the name "Archangel Cat." The Crystal Palace, built under the direction of Prince Albert, Queen Victoria's husband, was the venue for the Great Exhibition in 1851 and was later used for displaying various items (living and non-living) for the residents of Victorian London, attracting international attention. In the mid-19th century, cat shows became regular and popular events.
      history_desc_3: The Russian Blue cat gained its own classification as early as 1912, following its introduction to the United States in the early 20th century. However, according to the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA), the breed truly captured the hearts of animal lovers after World War II, gaining popularity from the 1960s onward.
      history_desc_4: Russian Blue cats are an older, naturally occurring breed, which means they were not created by humans, unlike some other breeds. Due to their long history, the exact origin of the breed is unknown.
      health_problems: health_problems
      health_desc_1: The Russian Blue is generally healthy, and no genetic diseases are known. The breed enjoys a long lifespan, often reaching into the teens or even longer. However, it's worth noting that this cat breed may have a tendency towards dehydration, which can later lead to urinary tract issues.
      health_desc_2: "Excessive, uncontrolled appetite can contribute to obesity, so it is crucial to adhere to a feeding plan: high-quality food along with properly measured portions. A mature, healthy cat should have a weight in the range of 3-6.5 kg (7-15 pounds). Males tend to be heavier."
